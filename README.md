Aquatic species shows asymmetric distribution range shifts in native and non-native areas

The following R code was utilized in the article "Costa et al. (2020). Biological aspects of fish species from subsistence fisheries in 'Bons Sinais' estuary, Mozambique." The code involved performing Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) models to investigate the environmental factors that influence the occurrence and habitat preferences of the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1896, in native and non-native areas. The BART models were also used to predict the current and future distributions of the crab under two climate change scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5).
